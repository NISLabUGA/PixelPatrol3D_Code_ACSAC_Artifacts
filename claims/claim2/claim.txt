RQ2: Can PP_det accurately identify instances of BMAs captured on a new screen size never seen during training?

This claim addresses Research Question 2 from the paper "PP3D: An In-Browser Vision-Based Defense Against Web Behavior Manipulation Attacks".

RQ2 evaluates whether PP_det can accurately identify BMA instances captured on screen resolutions that were never seen during training, testing the model's resolution-agnostic capabilities.

The experiment uses a leave-one-out evaluation methodology across 9 different screen resolutions (5 landscape, 4 portrait). For each resolution:
- The model is trained on data from all other 8 resolutions
- Testing is performed exclusively on the held-out resolution
- Up to 10 images per BMA campaign are selected for balanced evaluation
- 500 benign samples are included per test set

The multimodal classifier combines MobileNetV3-Small visual features with BERT-mini text features, using a resolution-agnostic preprocessing pipeline that handles arbitrary input dimensions through scaling and padding.

Expected Results:
- Detection rate at or above 99% at 1% false positive rate across all 9 test resolutions
- AUROC score at or above 0.999 for all resolution tests
- Global performance: 99.8% detection rate at 1% FPR, 0.999 AUROC

This demonstrates the model's ability to generalize across diverse screen resolutions and device form factors without requiring resolution-specific training.
