RQ2: Can PP_det accurately identify instances of BMAs captured on a new screen size never seen during training?

This claim addresses Research Question 2 from the paper "PP3D: An In-Browser Vision-Based Defense Against Web Behavior Manipulation Attacks".

RQ2 evaluates whether PP_det can accurately identify BMA instances captured on screen resolutions that were never seen during training, testing the model's resolution-agnostic capabilities.

The experiment uses a leave-one-out evaluation methodology across 9 different screen resolutions (5 landscape, 4 portrait). For each resolution:
- The model is trained on data from all other 8 resolutions
- Testing is performed exclusively on the held-out resolution
- Up to 10 images per BMA campaign are selected for balanced evaluation
- 500 benign samples are included per test set

## Directory to Resolution Mapping

For reviewer clarity, the following mapping exists between directory names and actual screen resolutions:

**Landscape Resolutions:**
- `1.land_excluded` → 1366x768 (Standard laptop resolution)
- `2.land_excluded` → 1920x998 (Full HD desktop with browser chrome)
- `3.land_excluded` → 1478x837 (Mid-range laptop resolution)
- `4.land_excluded` → 1536x824 (High-DPI laptop resolution)
- `5.land_excluded` → 1366x728 (Standard laptop with reduced height)

**Portrait Resolutions:**
- `1.port_excluded` → 800x1280 (Tablet portrait mode)
- `2.port_excluded` → 414x896 (iPhone X/11/12 series)
- `3.port_excluded` → 768x1024 (iPad portrait mode)
- `4.port_excluded` → 360x640 (Android phone standard)

Each leave-one-out experiment trains on 8 resolutions and tests on the remaining resolution to evaluate cross-resolution generalization.

The multimodal classifier combines MobileNetV3-Small visual features with BERT-mini text features, using a resolution-agnostic preprocessing pipeline that handles arbitrary input dimensions through scaling and padding.

Expected Results:
- Detection rate at or above 99% at 1% false positive rate across all 9 test resolutions
- AUROC score at or above 0.999 for all resolution tests
- Global performance: 99.8% detection rate at 1% FPR, 0.999 AUROC

This demonstrates the model's ability to generalize across diverse screen resolutions and device form factors without requiring resolution-specific training.
