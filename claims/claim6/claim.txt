Training Verification: RQ5 Adversarial Model (tt_comb_adv.py)

This claim verifies that the adversarial training process for RQ5 works correctly and demonstrates which epoch model was selected for adversarial robustness evaluation.

## Purpose

This training verification test case is designed to:
1. Verify that the adversarial training pipeline for tt_comb_adv.py functions correctly
2. Demonstrate the adversarial training process and robustness improvements
3. Show that epoch 7 produces the best adversarially robust model
4. Allow reviewers to understand adversarial training without full resource commitment

**Important**: This is NOT a full training run. It runs for limited epochs to verify the adversarial training process works correctly.

## Target Model

- **Script**: `artifacts/train_test/tt_comb_adv.py`
- **Target Model**: `artifacts/models/rq5/m_adv_ep7.pth`
- **Selected Epoch**: 7 (best adversarial robustness on validation data)
- **Usage**: This model demonstrates improved robustness against adversarial attacks for RQ5
- **Baseline Comparison**: `artifacts/models/rq5/m_no_adv_ep4.pth` (identical to RQ1/RQ4 model)

## Model Selection Rationale

The epoch 7 adversarial model (`m_adv_ep7.pth`) was selected because:
- Achieved highest detection rate under adversarial perturbations
- Demonstrated substantial robustness improvement over non-adversarial baseline
- Maintained strong performance on clean (non-adversarial) examples
- Showed stable adversarial training convergence without degradation

## Adversarial Training Configuration

The adversarial training uses the following key parameters:
- **Base Architecture**: Same as RQ1/RQ4 (MobileNetV3-Small + BERT-mini + fusion MLP)
- **Adversarial Curriculum**: Progressive adversarial example integration
- **Visual Perturbations**: PGD L-infinity attacks with ε ∈ {2, 4, 8, 16, 32}/255
- **Text Perturbations**: 5 levels of increasing severity (character noise to semantic inversion)
- **Training Strategy**: Mixed clean and adversarial examples
- **Loss Function**: Weighted Cross-Entropy on adversarial examples

## Expected Training Behavior

During adversarial training verification, reviewers should observe:

1. **Adversarial Loss Progression**: Both clean and adversarial loss should decrease
2. **Robustness Improvement**: Validation performance under attack should improve over epochs
3. **Clean Performance Maintenance**: Performance on clean examples should remain high
4. **Convergence**: Adversarial training typically requires more epochs (peak around epoch 7)
5. **Stability**: Training should be stable despite adversarial perturbations

## Verification Runtime

- **Limited Epochs**: ~3 epochs for verification (vs. 10+ for full adversarial training)
- **Expected Time**: 3-4 hours on modern GPU, 8-12 hours on CPU
- **Output Size**: ~3-4 GB for logs, checkpoints, and adversarial evaluation results
- **Note**: Adversarial training is more computationally intensive than standard training

## Understanding Output

The adversarial training verification will produce:

1. **Training Logs**: Progress with both clean and adversarial loss values
2. **Model Checkpoints**: `adv_detector_epoch_X.pth` files
3. **Adversarial Evaluation**: Performance under different attack strengths
4. **Robustness Metrics**: Detection rates at various adversarial perturbation levels
5. **Comparison Results**: Before vs. after adversarial training performance

## Key Metrics to Monitor

During verification, look for:
- **Clean Performance**: Should remain >99% detection rate at 1% FPR
- **Adversarial Robustness**: Substantial improvement over baseline at higher perturbation levels
- **Level 4 Performance**: Target >95% detection rate (vs. ~56% for non-adversarial model)
- **Level 5 Performance**: Target >95% detection rate (vs. ~4% for non-adversarial model)

## Full Training Considerations

If reviewers choose to run full adversarial training:
- **Time**: 10-15 hours on modern GPU
- **Epochs**: Typically converges by epoch 7-10
- **Memory Requirements**: Higher than standard training due to adversarial example generation
- **Expected Robustness**: Dramatic improvement in adversarial detection rates

## Comparison with Non-Adversarial Model

The verification will demonstrate the difference between:
- **m_no_adv_ep4.pth**: Vulnerable to adversarial attacks (4% detection at high perturbation)
- **m_adv_ep7.pth**: Robust against adversarial attacks (>99% detection at high perturbation)

This verification demonstrates that adversarial training significantly improves model robustness while maintaining clean performance, validating the RQ5 claims about adversarial defense capabilities.
