# Expected Results for Training Verification: RQ5 Adversarial Model

## Overview

This adversarial training verification demonstrates that the adversarial training process for RQ5 works correctly and shows why epoch 7 was selected for the adversarial robustness evaluation.

## Expected Training Behavior

### Training Time

- **Per Epoch**: ~45 minutes (V100 32GB GPU, adversarial training overhead)
- **Verification (1-2 epochs)**: ~45-90 minutes (recommended for reviewers)
- **Full Training (7 epochs)**: ~5.25 hours (not necessary for verification)

### Adversarial Training Progress

The verification run should demonstrate:

1. **Initialization**: Adversarial training pipeline initializes successfully
2. **Adversarial Example Generation**: PGD attacks and text perturbations created
3. **Mixed Training**: Both clean and adversarial examples used in training
4. **Robustness Evaluation**: Performance tested under different attack strengths
5. **Checkpointing**: Adversarially trained models saved at each epoch

## Key Metrics to Verify

### Training Log Verification

Check `training_log.log` for:

- Adversarial example generation progress
- Mixed clean and adversarial batch processing
- Decreasing adversarial loss over epochs
- Successful robustness evaluation completion

### Performance Metrics

Each `eval_metrics.txt` should contain:

- **Clean Performance**: Maintained >95% detection rate
- **Adversarial Performance**: Improving robustness over epochs
- **AUC Score**: >0.95 for clean, improving for adversarial
- **Detection Rate @ 1% FPR**: Progressive improvement under attack

## Understanding Epoch Selection

The verification demonstrates early adversarial training, but in full training:

- **Epoch 7** typically shows peak adversarial robustness
- **Clean performance** remains high throughout training
- **Robustness gains** continue improving until epoch 7
- **Stability** achieved without degrading clean performance

### Adversarial Training Dynamics

The verification should show:

- **Initial Vulnerability**: High susceptibility to adversarial attacks
- **Gradual Hardening**: Progressive robustness improvement
- **Balanced Learning**: Clean performance maintained while gaining robustness

## Comparison with Non-Adversarial Model

### Baseline Performance (m_no_adv_ep4.pth)

- **Clean**: 100% detection rate at 1% FPR
- **Level 4**: ~56% detection rate at 1% FPR
- **Level 5**: ~4% detection rate at 1% FPR

### Expected Adversarial Training Improvement

- **Clean**: Maintained ~99% detection rate
- **Level 4**: Target >95% detection rate (vs. 56% baseline)
- **Level 5**: Target >95% detection rate (vs. 4% baseline)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Issues**: Adversarial training requires more GPU memory
2. **Slow Training**: Adversarial example generation adds computational overhead
3. **Instability**: Adversarial training can be less stable than clean training
4. **Poor Robustness**: Verify adversarial example generation is working

### Expected Warnings

Normal warnings that may appear:

- Foolbox library initialization messages
- Adversarial attack generation notifications
- Higher memory usage warnings
- Longer batch processing times

## Validation Criteria

The adversarial training verification is successful if:

1. **Training Completes**: All 3 epochs finish without errors
2. **Clean Performance Maintained**: >95% detection rate on clean examples
3. **Robustness Improves**: Better performance under adversarial attacks
4. **Files Generated**: All expected output files including adversarial evaluations
5. **Progressive Improvement**: Robustness metrics improve over epochs

## Verification vs. Full Training

### Recommended Verification (1-2 epochs)

- **Purpose**: Verify adversarial training pipeline works correctly
- **Time**: ~45-90 minutes
- **Sufficient to demonstrate**: Adversarial example generation, mixed training, robustness evaluation
- **Cost-effective**: Minimal compute resources required

### Optional Full Training (7 epochs)

- **Purpose**: Reproduce exact adversarial model performance
- **Time**: ~5.25 hours
- **Not necessary for verification**: Claims 1-4 already provide reproducibility testing
- **Peak Robustness**: Typically achieved at epoch 7
- **Final Model**: `artifacts/models/rq5/m_adv_ep7.pth`

**Note**: Running 1-2 epochs is sufficient to verify the adversarial training process works correctly and is the recommended approach for reviewers. Full training is not necessary since claims 1-4 already handle reproducibility verification.

## Key Insights

This verification demonstrates:

- **Adversarial Training Effectiveness**: Substantial robustness improvement
- **Clean Performance Preservation**: No degradation on clean examples
- **Attack Resistance**: Progressive hardening against adversarial perturbations
- **Practical Defense**: Viable approach for real-world deployment

The adversarial training verification validates that the approach significantly improves model robustness while maintaining clean performance, supporting the RQ5 claims about adversarial defense capabilities.
