## Overview

This adversarial training verification demonstrates that the adversarial training process for RQ5 works correctly and shows why epoch 7 was selected for the adversarial robustness evaluation.

## Expected Training Behavior

### Adversarial Training Progress

The verification run should demonstrate:

## Expected Performance Progression

### Training Loss

- **Epoch 1**: Adversarial loss ~0.8-1.2 (higher than clean training)
- **Epoch 2**: Loss should decrease to ~0.5-0.8
- **Epoch 3**: Further decrease to ~0.4-0.7

### Clean Performance (No Perturbation)

- **Epoch 1**: Detection rate ~90-95% at 1% FPR
- **Epoch 2**: Detection rate ~95-98% at 1% FPR
- **Epoch 3**: Detection rate ~98-99% at 1% FPR

### Adversarial Robustness (Level 4: ε=16/255)

- **Epoch 1**: Detection rate ~20-40% at 1% FPR
- **Epoch 2**: Detection rate ~40-70% at 1% FPR
- **Epoch 3**: Detection rate ~60-85% at 1% FPR

### Adversarial Robustness (Level 5: ε=32/255)

- **Epoch 1**: Detection rate ~5-15% at 1% FPR
- **Epoch 2**: Detection rate ~15-35% at 1% FPR
- **Epoch 3**: Detection rate ~25-50% at 1% FPR

## Key Metrics to Verify

### Training Log Verification

Check `training_log.log` for:

- Adversarial example generation progress
- Mixed clean and adversarial batch processing
- Decreasing adversarial loss over epochs
- Successful robustness evaluation completion

### Performance Metrics

Each `eval_metrics.txt` should contain:

- **Clean Performance**: Maintained >95% detection rate
- **Adversarial Performance**: Improving robustness over epochs
- **AUC Score**: >0.95 for clean, improving for adversarial
- **Detection Rate @ 1% FPR**: Progressive improvement under attack

### Robustness Progression

Expected improvement pattern:

- **Level 1-2**: Minimal impact, >90% detection rate maintained
- **Level 3**: Moderate impact, >70% detection rate by epoch 3
- **Level 4**: Significant improvement from ~56% baseline to >60%
- **Level 5**: Dramatic improvement from ~4% baseline to >25%

## Understanding Epoch Selection

### Why Epoch 7 in Full Training

The verification demonstrates early adversarial training, but in full training:

- **Epoch 7** typically shows peak adversarial robustness
- **Clean performance** remains high throughout training
- **Robustness gains** continue improving until epoch 7
- **Stability** achieved without degrading clean performance

### Adversarial Training Dynamics

The verification should show:

- **Initial Vulnerability**: High susceptibility to adversarial attacks
- **Gradual Hardening**: Progressive robustness improvement
- **Balanced Learning**: Clean performance maintained while gaining robustness

## Comparison with Non-Adversarial Model

### Baseline Performance (m_no_adv_ep4.pth)

- **Clean**: 100% detection rate at 1% FPR
- **Level 4**: ~56% detection rate at 1% FPR
- **Level 5**: ~4% detection rate at 1% FPR

### Expected Adversarial Training Improvement

- **Clean**: Maintained ~99% detection rate
- **Level 4**: Target >60% detection rate (vs. 56% baseline)
- **Level 5**: Target >25% detection rate (vs. 4% baseline)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Memory Issues**: Adversarial training requires more GPU memory
2. **Slow Training**: Adversarial example generation adds computational overhead
3. **Instability**: Adversarial training can be less stable than clean training
4. **Poor Robustness**: Verify adversarial example generation is working

### Expected Warnings

Normal warnings that may appear:

- Foolbox library initialization messages
- Adversarial attack generation notifications
- Higher memory usage warnings
- Longer batch processing times

## Validation Criteria

The adversarial training verification is successful if:

1. **Training Completes**: All 3 epochs finish without errors
2. **Clean Performance Maintained**: >95% detection rate on clean examples
3. **Robustness Improves**: Better performance under adversarial attacks
4. **Files Generated**: All expected output files including adversarial evaluations
5. **Progressive Improvement**: Robustness metrics improve over epochs

## Full Adversarial Training Expectations

If running full adversarial training (10+ epochs):

- **Peak Robustness**: Typically achieved at epoch 7
- **Final Model**: `artifacts/models/rq5/m_adv_ep7.pth`
- **Clean Performance**: >99% detection rate at 1% FPR
- **Level 4 Robustness**: >98% detection rate at 1% FPR
- **Level 5 Robustness**: >99% detection rate at 1% FPR

## Key Insights

This verification demonstrates:

- **Adversarial Training Effectiveness**: Substantial robustness improvement
- **Clean Performance Preservation**: No degradation on clean examples
- **Attack Resistance**: Progressive hardening against adversarial perturbations
- **Practical Defense**: Viable approach for real-world deployment

The adversarial training verification validates that the approach significantly improves model robustness while maintaining clean performance, supporting the RQ5 claims about adversarial defense capabilities.
