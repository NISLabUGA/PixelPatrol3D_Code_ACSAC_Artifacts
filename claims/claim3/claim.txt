RQ3: Can PP_det identify web pages belonging to never-before-seen BMA campaigns?

This claim addresses Research Question 3 from the paper "PP3D: An In-Browser Vision-Based Defense Against Web Behavior Manipulation Attacks".

RQ3 evaluates whether PP_det can identify web pages belonging to completely unseen BMA campaigns, testing the model's ability to generalize across diverse attack types and visual/textual patterns without having seen specific campaign examples during training.

The experiment uses a leave-one-out evaluation methodology across 10 different BMA campaigns representing various attack categories:
- Notification Stealing (multiple campaigns)
- Fake Software Download (multiple campaigns) 
- Service Sign-up Scam
- Fake Lottery/Sweepstakes
- Technical Support Scam

For each campaign:
- The model is trained on data from all other 9 campaigns
- Testing is performed exclusively on the held-out campaign
- 5,000 benign samples are included per test set
- Campaign sizes vary from 15 to 910 samples

The multimodal classifier combines MobileNetV3-Small visual features with BERT-mini text features, learning to detect attack patterns that generalize across different campaign implementations.

Expected Results:
- Detection rate at or above 99% at 1% false positive rate across all 10 test campaigns
- AUROC score at or above 0.996 for all campaign tests
- Global performance: 99.3% detection rate at 1% FPR, 0.999 AUROC

This demonstrates the model's ability to generalize to never-before-seen BMA campaigns based on learned attack patterns from other campaigns.
