RQ1 & RQ4: Can PP_det accurately identify new instances of BMAs belonging to previously observed campaigns and fresh BMA attacks collected well after training data?

This claim addresses Research Questions 1 and 4 from the paper "PP3D: An In-Browser Vision-Based Defense Against Web Behavior Manipulation Attacks". 

RQ1 evaluates whether PP_det can accurately identify new instances of BMAs belonging to previously observed campaigns, while RQ4 tests the model's ability to detect fresh BMA attacks that were collected well after the training data (temporal generalization).

The experiment uses a multimodal binary classifier that combines MobileNetV3-Small for visual features and BERT-mini for text features. The model is trained on a dataset of 19,536 BMA samples and 100,000 benign samples, then evaluated on:
- RQ1: 500 new BMA instances from previously seen campaigns + 500 benign samples
- RQ4: 138 fresh BMA samples collected months after training + 500 benign samples

Expected Results:
- RQ1: Detection rate above 99% at 1% false positive rate, AUROC score of 1.0
- RQ4: Detection rate above 97% at 1% false positive rate, AUROC score above 0.999

This demonstrates the model's ability to generalize to new attack instances and maintain performance over time against evolving BMA campaigns.
