# PP3D Dataset Structure

To access the data associated with this project we has hosted the data [here](http://pp3d_data.sdkhomelab.com/). This directory contains the datasets used in the PP3D (Pixel Patrol 3D) research paper "An In-Browser Vision-Based Defense Against Web Behavior Manipulation Attacks" submitted to ACSAC 2025. The datasets are organized to support the various research questions (RQs) investigated in the paper.

## Research Questions Overview

The paper investigates five key research questions:

- **RQ1**: Can PP_det accurately identify new instances of BMAs belonging to previously observed campaigns?
- **RQ2**: Can PP_det accurately identify instances of BMAs captured on a new screen size never seen during training?
- **RQ3**: Can PP_det identify web pages belonging to never-before-seen BMA campaigns?
- **RQ4**: Can PP_det accurately identify fresh BMA attacks that were collected well after the training data?
- **RQ5**: Can PP_det be strengthened against adversarial examples?

## Directory Structure Requirements

The pp_detect scripts require the following directory structure under `pp3d_data/`:

- `raw/` - Contains raw, unprocessed data collection
- `train/` - Processed training datasets
- `test/` - Evaluation test datasets
- `l1o/` - Leave-one-out experiment data

Each directory must be populated with the appropriate dataset files for the scripts to function correctly.

### `/raw/` - Raw Data Collection

Contains the original, unprocessed data collected for the study:

- **`benign_cc/`**: Benign websites collected from Common Crawl dataset

  - Contains legitimate website screenshots and metadata from 10,000 URLs randomly selected from Web Extraction (WET) files
  - Used as negative samples for training and evaluation
  - Provides diverse, less popular websites to complement the Tranco dataset

- **`benign_tranco/`**: Benign websites from Tranco Top 1M list

  - Contains screenshots of the top 5,000 domains from the Tranco list
  - Represents popular, high-traffic legitimate websites
  - Provides additional negative samples with well-established sites

- **`malicious/`**: Raw malicious BMA data collected

  - Contains unprocessed BMA screenshots from various attack campaigns
  - Includes data from both primary and secondary collection efforts
  - Covers multiple BMA categories: fake software downloads, scareware, tech support scams, notification stealing, fake lotteries/sweepstakes, and service registration scams

### `/train/` - Training Data (RQ1, RQ4, RQ5)

Contains the processed training datasets used for model development:

- **`benign/train_100k/`**: Training set of benign websites

  - 100,000 unaugmented screenshots randomly sampled from the broader benign collection

- **`malicious/`**: Training set of malicious BMA pages

  - 6,512 unaugmented screenshot-text pairs from primary BMA collection
  - Augmented to 19,536 samples using image and text augmentation techniques
  - Covers 74 distinct BMA campaigns across 6 attack categories
  - Each screenshot paired with OCR-extracted text for multimodal training

- **`malicious_adv/`**: Adversarial training set

  - Contains adversarially augmented BMA samples for RQ5
  - Includes both visual perturbations (using PGD with ε ∈ {2,4,8,16,32}/255) and textual perturbations (5 levels of increasing severity)
  - Used for adversarial training to improve model robustness

### `/test/` - Test Data (RQ1, RQ4, RQ5)

Contains test datasets for evaluating different aspects of the model:

#### `/test/rq1/` - Basic Detection Performance

- **`benign/test_500/`**: 500 benign test samples across multiple screen resolutions

  - Organized by resolution directories (e.g., `360x640/`, `1920x1080/`, etc.)
  - Completely separate from training data
  - Used to evaluate basic detection capabilities on new instances of previously seen campaigns

- **`malicious/test_500/d1/`**: 500 malicious test samples

  - BMA samples from campaigns seen during training but different instances
  - Tests model's ability to generalize to new attack instances within known campaigns

#### `/test/rq4/` - Temporal Generalization

- **`benign/test_500/`**: 500 benign samples for temporal testing

  - Similar structure to RQ1 benign test set
  - Used as negative samples for temporal generalization evaluation

- **`malicious/test_138/`**: 138 fresh BMA samples

  - Contains BMA data from the secondary collection conducted months after training
  - Represents 10 new, never-before-seen BMA campaigns
  - Tests model's ability to detect temporally distant and evolving attack content

#### `/test/rq5/` - Adversarial Robustness

- **`benign/test_500/`**: Clean benign samples for adversarial evaluation
- **`malicious/`**: Adversarial test sets with different perturbation levels
  - `l1/` through `l5/`: Increasingly severe adversarial perturbations
  - Tests model robustness against coordinated multimodal adversarial attacks

### `/l1o/` - Leave-One-Out Experiments (RQ2, RQ3)

Contains data for leave-one-out cross-validation experiments:

- **RQ2 Data**: Leave-one-out experiments for screen resolution generalization

  - Tests model performance on previously unseen screen resolutions
  - 9 different training/test splits excluding one resolution at a time
  - Evaluates resolution agnosticism of the PP_det model

- **RQ3 Data**: Leave-one-out experiments for campaign generalization

  - Tests model performance on never-before-seen BMA campaigns
  - 10 different training/test splits excluding one campaign at a time
  - Evaluates model's ability to generalize across different attack campaigns
